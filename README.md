# House-Price-prediction

This project aims to develop a predictive model for accurately estimating residential property prices using machine learning and regression techniques. In the context of today's dynamic real estate market, accurate price predictions are essential for enabling buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to make data-driven decisions. The model will be trained on a dataset containing key property features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location. The project involves comprehensive steps including data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection, model development, and performance evaluation. A variety of regression algorithms—such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—will be explored to determine the most effective approach. The primary goal is to identify the key drivers of property value and create a model capable of delivering reliable predictions, ultimately contributing valuable insights to support informed decision-making in real estate transactions.
